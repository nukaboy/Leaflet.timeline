# Leaflet.timespan

This project is a fork of [Leaflet.timeline](https://github.com/skeate/Leaflet.timeline) using a range slider
provided by [noUiSlider](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/) instead of the standard HTML slider.


## How to use

The package can be implemented just like Leaflet.timeline, see their documentation for more information.

## Future plans

This project will develop distinctive Features. 
- While you will be able to choose between timelines (single handle like the original project) and timespans, the animation feature will be removed as it adds no value to the timespan feature. 
- A new documentation focusing on the difference between the projects will be added.
