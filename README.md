# Leaflet.timespan

This project is a fork of [Leaflet.timeline](https://github.com/skeate/Leaflet.timeline) using a range slider
provided by [noUiSlider](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/) instead of the standard HTML slider.


## How to use

The package can be implemented just like Leaflet.timeline, see their documentation for more information.
